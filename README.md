### Pre-Processing Steps
-  Explanatory Data Analysis of each column and checking the distribution
- finding which columns contribute to the label most
<br><br>
### Statistical Anaylsis

### Methodology
1. **Business Understanding** 
Building a model which can detect sarcasam in text which has applications in things like online shops, websites that give reviews, forums that disucss items and much more. Therefore we are building this model so that it can be used as a 3rd party application for the specific business needs of our customers

3. **Modelling**
Baseline model is Logistic Regression
optimized logistic regression through gridsearch
used RandomForest with gridsearch to improve results
applied GradientBoost to further improve results
Finally applied Neural network to get the best results
